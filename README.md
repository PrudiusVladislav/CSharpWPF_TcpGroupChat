- MSSQL Server

## Project Structure

- **Server**: Console Application
  - Listens for incoming connections using `TcpListener`.
  - Manages clients (adding new ones, updating online status).
  - Manages the messages
- **Client**: WPF Application
  - Connects to the server using `TcpClient`.
  - Always ready to receive a message

### Database

The application uses MSSQL Server to store all the data. You can configure the database connection adding your `appSettings.json`.

## Usage

Here are some of the basic actions a user can do within the chat app:

### Authentication

Before entering the chat, every user should login or register

### Sending messages

- **Choose chat**
  After you logged in, you can choose a _private chat_ (marked with a @) to communicate with another user directly, or a _group chat_, where all the members will be able to see your message. To choose a chat you can click on one of the chat names from the list on the left side of the window:

- **Enter and send message**
  When you you have chosen a chat, you can enter a text message in the _input_ field at the bottom of the window, and then press the _send_ button that is right next to the input field:

### Creating a group chat

You can also create a _new group chat_, instead of communicating within existing ones. All the group chats within this app are _public_, and anyone can access them. But to appear as a _member_ of the group chat, you need to send a message to the chat, unless you are the creator of the group. The process of creation of a new group looks like this:

After that, the new group is going to appear in the list of chats:

### Disconnect

After you've done everything you needed within the chat app, you can easily disconnect, by pressing the _disconnect button_:
